All of these scripts are still under development  - some have hard coded values for specific datasets.

all use the analyse_projections_along_eigenvectors.txt generated by relion_flex_analyze run with the --write_pca_projections flag added.

Complete readme wwill come later when the scripts are more mature... 

most give usage instructions when run with no arguments
